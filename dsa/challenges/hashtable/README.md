## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

[] add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
[] get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
[] contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
[] hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
