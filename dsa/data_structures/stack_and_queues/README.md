# Stacks and Queues

__PR request__:

## Challenge
* Create a Node class with properties of values and pointer
*  Create a Stack class that has a top property. *  It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
*  This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
* Define a method called __push__ which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called __pop__ that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and __returns the node’s value__.
* Should __raise exception__ when called on empty stack
* Define a method called __peek__ that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
*  Should __raise exception__ when called on empty stack
* Define a method called __isEmpty__ that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
