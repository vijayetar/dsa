__PR__:

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

__AddNode()__
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
__AddEdge()__
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph, include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edgeb both nodes should already be in the Graph
__GetNodes()__
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
__GetNeighbors()__
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
__Size()__
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
