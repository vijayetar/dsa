__PR__: https://github.com/vijayetar/dsa/pull/14  

## Challenge
* Create a __Node class__ with the left child pointing, and the right child poininting to node.
* Create a __BinaryTree class__
* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called __preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder__ which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
* Any __exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors__. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

* Create a __BinarySearchTree class__
* Define a method named __add__ that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named __contains__ that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
