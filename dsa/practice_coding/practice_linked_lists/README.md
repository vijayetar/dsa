# Linked Lists
####  page 94 from breaking the coding interview

[Answer](practice_linked_lists.py)


#### 2.1 Remove Duplicates from unsorted linked list.  Implement it with and without a temporary buffer

#### 2.3 Find the middle node from the linked list
Both mid and current start at the head, and for every two steps the current pointer advances, the mid pointer advances by 1

#### 2.3b find the middle node and remove it from the linked list

#### 2.4 Given ll, and partition value, use the partition value given and return a linked list with nodes sorted around the partition value

#### 2.5 given two ll with numeric values, return new ll with sum of the values

#### 2.6 function to check if linked list is a palindrome
* attempt using a temporary buffer such as list and then compare them to each other at either end until middle is reached.
* consider using a stack for first in first out approach until the middle is reached and then compare the rest of the linked list
