See [solution]()

__PR__:

## Challenge
Linked List created with the following methods:
__insert(int n)__ :method that takes in parameter integer and adds it to the front of the linked List and moves the head to the front
__isEmpty__ returns a boolean if the linked list is empty
__includes(int n)__:method that iterates through the linked list to check if the value n is present in the linked list.  

## Approach and Efficiency
__includes(int n)__: time O(n), space O(1)
__isEmpty()__: O(1)
__insert(int n)__: time O(1), space O(1)

## Specifications Used
* .editorconfig
* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
