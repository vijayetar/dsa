# Two Pointers Approach


## Problems
2.1 Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

__If we used brute force it is O(n2).  With a sorted array it can be O(nLogn). But with two pointers, it will be O(n) for efficiency and O(1) for space__

2.2 Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

2.3 Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the number of the input array in the sorted order.

2.4 Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
